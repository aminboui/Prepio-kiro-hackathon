# FixorAI - 3-Minute Demo Video Script

## üé¨ **INTRO (0:00 - 0:15)**

"Hi! I'm excited to show you FixorAI, a comprehensive AI-powered coding education platform I built entirely using Kiro IDE for the hackathon. FixorAI combines personalized challenges, gamification, progress tracking, and professional user management into a complete SaaS experience. Let me show you how Kiro made this incredible platform possible."

## üõ† **HOW I STRUCTURED CONVERSATIONS WITH KIRO (0:15 - 0:45)**

"Building this comprehensive platform with Kiro was incredibly efficient thanks to structured conversations. Let me show you the key files that guided development."

*[Open .kiro directory in file explorer]*

"I used steering rules to establish our design system - dark theme, electric blue colors, and professional SaaS architecture. This ensured Kiro consistently followed our design principles."

*[Open .kiro/steering/project-guidelines.md]*

"The specs became our living documentation, tracking everything from AI integration to the gamification system with 8 levels and badge unlocking."

*[Open .kiro/specs/ai-coding-platform.md and scroll through features]*

"Agent hooks provided automated quality assurance - TypeScript checking, linting, and build validation on every save."

*[Open .kiro/hooks/test-on-save.md]*

---

## üöÄ **MOST IMPRESSIVE CODE GENERATION (0:45 - 1:15)**

"Kiro's code generation was phenomenal. First, the complete gamification system - I described wanting a Duolingo-style level system, and Kiro generated 8 unique levels with badges, emojis, and progression logic."

*[Show src/lib/levels.ts - scroll through the level definitions]*

"Then the professional authentication system - dedicated signin/signup pages with glass morphism design, protected routes, and smart redirects."

*[Show src/app/auth/signin/page.tsx and the AuthGuard component]*

"The comprehensive profile dashboard with analytics, progress tracking, and badge showcase - all generated with perfect TypeScript integration."

*[Show src/app/profile/page.tsx - scroll through the dashboard components]*

"And the secure AI integration with server-side API routes, intelligent evaluation, and anti-cheating detection."

*[Show src/app/api/evaluate-solution/route.ts]*

---

## üìã **SPEC-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT APPROACH (1:15 - 1:45)**

"The spec-driven approach enabled building this complex platform systematically. The specification evolved from a simple coding challenge app to a comprehensive SaaS platform with user management, gamification, and analytics."

*[Show the spec file, highlighting the extensive features list]*

"Every major feature - from the level system to the professional auth pages - was guided by the spec. Kiro used this context to generate consistent, integrated code that worked together seamlessly."

"The spec tracked our evolution: starting with basic challenges, adding progress tracking, then gamification, then professional authentication - each phase building on the previous architecture."

## üéØ **LIVE DEMO OF THE COMPLETE PLATFORM (1:45 - 2:45)**

"Let me show you the complete platform in action."

*[Navigate to the landing page]*

"Here's our professional landing page with dual mode selection. Users can choose Practice Mode for skill building or our new Interview Prep Mode for complete interview simulation."

*[Show both buttons: Practice Mode and Interview Prep Mode]*

"Let me show you the Interview Prep Mode first - this is our game-changing feature."

*[Click "Interview Prep Mode"]*

"Users select their target company type, role, experience level, and programming language. This creates a completely personalized interview experience."

*[Show the 4-card selection system]*

"Once configured, they get a complete 4-stage interview simulation with real-time timers, voice recognition, and comprehensive AI evaluation."

*[Click through to show the session page]*

"Now let me show Practice Mode for comparison."

*[Navigate back and click "Practice Mode"]*

"The challenge setup is intuitive - 10 programming languages, 3 skill levels, and 2 challenge types. The AI generates personalized challenges instantly."

*[Select JavaScript, Intermediate, Bug Fix, and start challenge]*

"Here's the professional coding interface with Monaco Editor - the same editor used in VS Code. Notice the syntax highlighting, hints system, and the 'Track Progress' button."

*[Show the interface, click Track Progress]*

"If not signed in, users get redirected to our beautiful authentication pages with glass morphism design and professional branding."

*[Show the signin page, then signup page]*

"After signing up, users access their comprehensive profile dashboard. Look at this - we have an 8-level progression system with unique badges, from Code Hatchling to Code Cosmos!"

*[Navigate to profile page, show the level system]*

"The analytics are comprehensive - total challenges, success rates, language breakdown, and recent activity. It's like having a personal coding coach."

*[Show the statistics and progress tracking]*

"The gamification system shows current level, progress to next level, and badge collection - just like Duolingo but for coding skills!"

*[Show the badge showcase and level progression]*

"Back to coding - let me submit a solution and show you the AI evaluation system."

*[Submit a solution and show the comprehensive feedback with scoring]*

"The AI provides detailed feedback on correctness, efficiency, and code quality, with specific suggestions for improvement. It even detects if you submit unchanged code!"
