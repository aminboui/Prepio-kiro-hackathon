# Test on Save Hook

## Trigger
When any TypeScript or JavaScript file is saved in the project

## Action
Automatically run type checking and linting to ensure code quality

## Implementation
```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run ESLint for code quality
npx eslint src/ --ext .ts,.tsx,.js,.jsx

# Run build to ensure everything compiles
npm run build
```

## Purpose
Maintain code quality and catch issues early in development process for the AI coding challenge platform.

## Impact on Development
This hook significantly improved our development workflow by:
- Catching TypeScript errors immediately upon save
- Ensuring consistent code style across the project
- Preventing broken builds from being committed
- Providing instant feedback during development
- Maintaining high code quality standards throughout the project

## Usage in PrepioAI
This hook was particularly valuable when building complex React components like:
- ChallengeInterface with Monaco Editor integration
- API routes with proper TypeScript interfaces
- Secure AI service implementations
- Responsive UI components with Tailwind CSS
